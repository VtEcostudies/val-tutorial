  <h4>Next Step: Developing a Vermont Conservation Strategy for Pollinators</h4>
</div>

To effectively respond to heightened conservation concerns for wild bees and other pollinators, we will spearhead the development and implementation of a statewide plan for the conservation of Vermontâ€™s pollinators with a coalition of partners, including scientists, natural resource managers, decision makers, conservation planners, funders, and others. The plan will be a broad-based, scientifically-sound approach that incorporates needed research, population monitoring, management actions, and education and outreach. The plan of action will provide a framework to guide initiatives across Vermont. By working together with a diverse group of stakeholders, we will help shape a landscape where wild bees and other pollinators can flourish and continue to provide vital ecosystem services now and for future generations.
<br>

Broad, long term goals of the strategy will include:

<ul>
<li>Make Vermont's landscapes more pollinator friendly by working with farmers, public land managers, home owners, and others to help implement important management actions.</li>
<li>Help beekeepers achieve healthy, sustainable populations, and ensure honey bees are part of a cohesive pollinator message that balances managed and wild pollinator populations.</li>
<li>Build capacity for both the field and taxonomic work necessary to monitor wild bee populations.</li>
<li>Increase outreach and education efforts to inspire more Vermonters to care for native bees, as well as the broader environment</li>
<li>Address important knowledge gaps through research and conduct population monitoring of certain species and locations to help track our progress.</li>
</ul>

Under the broader goals, examples of specific action items to be implemented would include:

<ul>
<li>Establish long-term monitoring routes for bumble bees across Vermont</li>
<li>Assess the current frequency and associated threats of mail-order mason bees and other managed species</li>
<li>Survey for species of regional conservation concern that have not yet been recorded in the state</li>
<li>Improve the quality and accessibility of occurrence and monitoring data collected within the state</li>
<li>Explore options for conservation actions targeted at maintaining working sandpits that can also support rare bees and other species reliant on these habitats</li>
</ul>
